## üõ†Ô∏è Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

You have two ways to install PostgreSQL:

1. Download the PostgreSQL server [here.](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and the [PostgreSQL container.](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

Whatever method you choose, then you will have to perform the data restoration and continue with the activities

## üìö Data Recovery <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /home/user/.../CompanySQL/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the CompanySQL folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge
